I thought Eon Altar was really cool and wanted to try to replicate the game mechanic. It uses ios apps as controllers/clients, and they connect to one steam game running locally. Just fiddling around with Unity Networking Engine.

This is my first time working with Unity and IOS, so starting with the docs/tutorials.
